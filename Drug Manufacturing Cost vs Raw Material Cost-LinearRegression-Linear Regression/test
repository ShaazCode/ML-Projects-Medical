In pharmaceutical manufacturing, raw material cost (APIs, excipients, chemicals) is one of the largest contributors to total manufacturing cost.
This project studies and predicts:
How changes in raw material cost affect total drug manufacturing cost
using Simple Linear Regression with only one input feature.
